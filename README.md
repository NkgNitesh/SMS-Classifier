# SMS-Classifier
The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify short message service (SMS) texts as either spam or non-spam (ham). This model aims to enhance text message filtering and improve user experience by automatically detecting and filtering out unwanted spam messages.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Explore and analyze a dataset of SMS messages to understand the characteristics of spam and non-spam messages.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess text data using techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.
- **Feature Extraction:** Convert text data into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Machine Learning Model:** Build a classification model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict whether a given SMS is spam or ham.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NkgNitesh/SMS-Classifier.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Google colab or Python script to train the SMS Spam Classifier model and make predictions.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Google colab containing the main project code.
- `data/`: Dataset files used for training and testing.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps outlined in the Usage section. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the implementation details and train the SMS Spam Classifier on your own dataset.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's improving the model, experimenting with different algorithms, or enhancing the documentation, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

This project is developed to address the challenge of spam detection in SMS messages and aims to contribute to the improvement of text message filtering systems.
